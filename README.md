## File Management Toolkit
This toolkit offers a duo of Python utilities designed to enhance your file handling capabilities. With one tool focused on generating and adding test files to a specified directory and the other enabling sophisticated file renaming operations, this suite is an essential addition to your productivity arsenal.

Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:


# File Creator (Tester.py)
This script allows you to automatically generate and add a specified number of test files with random names to a directory of your choosing.

# File Renamer (__init__.py)
The File Renamer tool, encapsulated in a user-friendly GUI, provides functionality to append to the start or end of file names, or remove specified segments from them.
